Introduction
============

This archlinux package derives from the current stock Archlinux kernel (as of the time of this
writing, 2011, the 2nd of november).

It is based on the blog articles that you can find [here](http://www.ioncannon.net/system-administration/1290/how-to-build-compile-a-custom-linux-kernel-for-ec2/)
and [here](http://worldmodscode.wordpress.com/2011/10/28/ec2-ami-creation-without-magic/).

Basically, the only change is the config file.

Currently, support is only present for i686 instances.
